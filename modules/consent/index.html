    <strong>Purpose of Study</strong><br>
    We aim to better understand how visualizations can be used to aid in reasoning problems. The result of this study would help in the improvement of future visualization designs. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Task Description</strong><br>
    You will be shown a visualization and text description of a reasoning problem and asked to answer two questions based on it. Please try to respond as accurately as possible. Afterwards, you will be asked to complete a task load questionnaire, a demographic questionnaire, a spatial ability questionnaire, and provide any additional feedack you wish.  
    <br><br>
    You will be paid a base price of $0.80 and an additional $0.10 for every correct response. Total possible compensation will be $3.00.
